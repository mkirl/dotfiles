Here's how to resolve it:\n\n1. First, check if you have any GPG keys:\n```bash\ngpg --list-keys\n```\n\n2. If you don't have any keys, create a new key pair:\n```bash\ngpg --full-generate-key\n```\nFollow the prompts to create your key.\n\n3. If you already have keys but they're not set as default, you can:\n- Either specify the key explicitly using the `-u` or `--local-user` option:\n```bash\ngpg --local-user YOUR_KEY_ID --clear-sign file\n```\n- Or set a default key in your `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`:\n```bash\ndefault-key YOUR_KEY_ID\n```\n\n4. Make sure your GPG agent is running:\n```bash\ngpg-agent --daemon\n```\n\n5. Verify your keys are properly configured:\n```bash\ngpg --list-secret-keys\n```\n\nThe key ID can be found in the output of `gpg --list-keys` or `gpg --list-secret-keys`. It's typically the 8 or 16 character hexadecimal number after the key type.\nWhat if I have a yubikey with keys \n\nIf you're using a YubiKey with GPG keys, you'll need to ensure:\n\n1. First, make sure your YubiKey is plugged in and recognized:\n```bash\ngpg --card-status\n```\n\n2. Check if the keys from your YubiKey are properly imported:\n```bash\ngpg --list-keys\n```\n\n3. If the keys aren't showing up, you may need to:\n   - Import the public key if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   gpg --card-edit\n   fetch    # This fetches the public key from the YubiKey\n   ```\n   \n   - Or import from your backup public key file:\n   ```bash\n   gpg --import your-public-key.asc\n   ```\n\n4. Make sure the GPG agent is running and configured for smart card use:\n```bash\ngpg-agent --daemon\n```\n\n5. In your `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`, you can set the default key to your YubiKey's key ID:\n```bash\ndefault-key YOUR_YUBIKEY_KEY_ID\n```\n\n6.

Let's fix this:\n\n1. First, check what email Git is configured to use:\n```bash\ngit config --get user.email\n```\n\n2. Then check your available GPG keys:\n```bash\ngpg --list-secret-keys\n```\n\n3. Make sure your YubiKey is plugged in and recognized:\n```bash\ngpg --card-status\n```\n\n4. If Git is configured to use a different signing key, update it:\n```bash\n# Get your key ID from gpg --list-keys\ngit config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID\n```\n\n5. Make sure Git is configured to sign commits:\n```bash\ngit config --global commit.gpgsign true\n```\n\n6.

Since you're using a YubiKey, let's fix this:\n\n1. First, make sure your YubiKey is inserted and check if it's recognized:\n```bash\ngpg --card-status\n```\n\n2. If your YubiKey is recognized, you need to import your public key first. If you have your public key backup file, import it:\n```bash\ngpg --import your-public-key.asc\n```\n\n3. If you don't have your public key file, but it's on a keyserver, you can fetch it:\n```bash\ngpg --recv-keys YOUR_KEY_ID\n```\n\n4. Make sure the gpg-agent and pcscd services are running:\n```bash\nsystemctl --user status gpg-agent\nsystemctl status pcscd\n```\n\n5. If needed, restart the GPG agent:\n```bash\ngpg-connect-agent killagent /bye\ngpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye\ngpg-connect-agent /bye\n```\n\nCan you run `gpg --card-status` and share the output? This will help us verify if your YubiKey is being recognized properly.\nI think my public key is on the computer that I configured the Yubikey with\nAh, that's important! Since you configured your YubiKey on a different computer, you'll need to:\n\n1. Go to the computer where you originally configured the YubiKey and export your public key:\n```bash\n# On the original computer\ngpg --export --armor your.email@example.com > public-key.asc\n```\n\n2. Transfer this `public-key.asc` file to your current computer (via secure file transfer, USB drive, etc.)\n\n3. On your current computer, import the public key:\n```bash\ngpg --import public-key.asc\n```\n\nUntil you do this, your current computer won't recognize your YubiKey's keys because it needs the public key component to work with the private key on the YubiKey.\n\nAlternatively, if you know your key ID or have published your key to a keyserver, you could fetch it directly:\n```bash\ngpg --recv-keys YOUR_KEY_ID\n```\n\nWould you like help with exporting the key from your other computer or importing it on this one?\nIve imported it now what\n\nNow that you've imported the public key, let's set everything up:\n\n1. First, verify the key is recognized:\n```bash\ngpg --list-keys\n```\n\n2. Configure Git to use your key. Get your key ID from the previous command and set it:\n```bash\ngit config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID\n```\n\n3. Make sure Git is using the correct email:\n```bash\ngit config --global user.email \"michael.e.kirl@gmail.com\"\n```\n\n4. Ensure commit signing is enabled:\n```bash\ngit config --global commit.gpgsign true\n```\n\n5. You might need to restart the GPG agent:\n```bash\ngpg-connect-agent killagent /bye\ngpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye\ngpg-connect-agent /bye\n```\n\nNow try your commit again:\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"add keys\"\n```\n\nIf you're still having issues, can you show me the output of `gpg --list-keys` so I can help you identify the correct key ID to use?\nSkipped key no secret key\nWhen you get \"Skipped key no secret key\" error, it means GPG can see your public key but can't access the private key on your YubiKey. Let's fix this:\n\n1. First, make sure your YubiKey is properly connected. Check if it's recognized:\n```bash\ngpg --card-status\n```\n\n2. Try to check if the private keys are available:\n```bash\ngpg --list-secret-keys\n```\n\n3. You might need to restart the gpg-agent and pcsc services:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart pcscd\ngpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye\ngpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye\n```\n\n4. If you're using NixOS (which I notice from your prompt), make sure you have these in your configuration:\n```nix\nservices.pcscd.enable = true;\nprograms.gnupg.agent = {\n  enable = true;\n  enableSSHSupport = true;\n  pinentryFlavor = \"curses\";  # or \"gtk\" if you prefer graphical\n};\n```\n\n5. Also ensure scdaemon is running:\n```bash\ngpg-connect-agent \"scd getinfo version\" /bye\n```\n\nCan you try running `gpg --card-status` and share what it shows? This will help us verify if your YubiKey is being properly recognized by the system.\ni am using macos\nAh, for macOS, let's fix this:\n\n1. First, install required dependencies using Homebrew if you haven't already:\n```bash\nbrew install gnupg pinentry-mac ykman\n```\n\n2. Configure GPG to use pinentry-mac. Edit or create `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`:\n```bash\npinentry-program /opt/homebrew/bin/pinentry-mac\n```\n\n3. Restart the GPG agent:\n```bash\ngpgconf --kill gpg-agent\ngpg-agent --daemon\n```\n\n4. Make sure your YubiKey is recognized:\n```bash\ngpg --card-status\n```\n\n5. If needed, update the GPG card status:\n```bash\ngpg-connect-agent \"scd serialno\" \"learn --force\" /bye\n```\n\n6. Reset the GPG agent and update the TTY:\n```bash\ngpg-connect-agent killagent /bye\ngpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye\ngpg-connect-agent /bye\n```\n\nAfter doing these steps, try your git commit again. If you're still having issues, can you run `gpg --card-status` and share what it shows?\ni am using nix darwin as package manager\nAh, for Nix Darwin, let's configure this properly:\n\n1. In your `configuration.nix` or `home.nix`, add these configurations:\n\n```nix\n{ config, pkgs, ... }: {\n  programs.gnupg = {\n    enable = true;\n    package = pkgs.gnupg;\n  };\n  \n  # Enable pcscd service\n  services.pcscd.enable = true;\n\n  # For home-manager\n  home.packages = with pkgs; [\n    pinentry_mac\n    yubikey-manager\n  ];\n}\n```\n\n2. Also ensure your GPG agent is configured. Create or edit `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`:\n```\npinentry-program /Applications/MacPorts/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac\nenable-ssh-support\n```\n\n3. After updating your configuration, rebuild:\n```bash\ndarwin-rebuild switch\n```\n\n4. Then restart the GPG agent:\n```bash\ngpgconf --kill gpg-agent\ngpg-agent --daemon\n```\n\n5. Check if your YubiKey is recognized:\n```bash\ngpg --card-status\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you with the specific Nix configuration, or should we troubleshoot the current GPG setup first?\nIs emacs worth learning\nYes, Emacs is worth learning, especially if you're already using Nix and interested in customizable, powerful tools. Here's why:\n\nPros:\n1. Extremely customizable using Elisp\n2. Great for Nix users (nix-mode, direnv integration)\n3. Can become your entire development environment\n4. Org-mode is unmatched for:\n   - Note-taking\n   - Task management\n   - Literate programming\n   - Document authoring\n5. Excellent version control integration\n6. Can be used as a terminal, email client, IRC client, etc.\n7. Has evil-mode for Vim keybindings if you prefer those\n\nCons:\n1. Steep learning curve\n2. Initial setup can be time-consuming\n3. Default keybindings can be awkward (though customizable)\n4. Elisp is another language to learn\n\nRecommended starting points:\n1. Try Doom Emacs for a pre-configured setup\n2. Or use Spacemacs if you want a more opinionated config\n3. Start with basic text editing and gradually add features\n4. Focus on learning org-mode early\n\nGiven your interest in Nix and customizable tools, you might particularly enjoy the power and flexibility Emacs offers. Would you like specific resources for getting started?\nyes\nHere's a structured path to learning Emacs, with focus on modern approaches:\n\n1. **Quick Start with Doom Emacs** (Recommended for beginners)\n```bash\n# Install\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.emacs.d\n~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install\n```\n- Tutorial: https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org\n- Doom Documentation: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/index.org\n\n2. **Essential Resources**\n- Built-in Tutorial: Inside Emacs, type `C-h t` (Control + h, then t)\n- Modern Emacs Guide: https://systemcrafters.net (Great YouTube channel)\n- Practical Emacs Tutorial: https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude\n- Org-mode Guide: https://orgmode.org/guide/\n\n3. **Specific Areas to Focus On**\n- Basic navigation (`C-n`, `C-p`, `C-f`, `C-b`)\n- Buffer management (`C-x b`, `C-x k`)\n- File operations (`C-x C-f`, `C-x C-s`)\n- Org-mode basics\n- Magit (Git interface)\n- Project management\n\n4. **Nix-specific Setup**\n```nix\n# In your home-manager config\nprograms.emacs = {\n  enable = true;\n  package = pkgs.emacs;\n  extraPackages = epkgs: [\n    epkgs.nix-mode\n    epkgs.direnv\n    # Add other packages you want\n  ];\n};\n```\n\n5. **Recommended YouTube Channels**\n- System Crafters\n- Protesilaos Stavrou\n- Uncle Dave's Emacs\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or provide more specific resources for a particular aspect?  \ni want to go through git history and revert some of the changes how can i do that\nThere are several ways to navigate and revert Git history:\n\n1. **View History First**:\n```bash\n# See commit history\ngit log\n\n# More compact view\ngit log --oneline\n\n# With graph visualization\ngit log --oneline --graph\n```\n\n2. **To Revert a Specific Commit** (creates a new commit that undoes changes):\n```bash\n# Find the commit hash from git log\ngit revert <commit-hash>\n```\n\n3. **To Reset to a Previous State** (BE CAREFUL - this changes history):\n```bash\n# Soft reset - keeps changes staged\ngit reset --soft <commit-hash>\n\n# Mixed reset - keeps changes unstaged\ngit reset --mixed <commit-hash>\n\n# Hard reset - discards all changes (DANGEROUS)\ngit reset --hard <commit-hash>\n```\n\n4. **To Interactively Choose Changes**:\n```bash\n# Interactive rebase\ngit rebase -i HEAD~n  # n is number of commits to go back\n\n# You'll see options like:\n# pick - keep commit\n# drop - remove commit\n# edit - stop and edit\n# squash - combine with previous commit\n```\n\n5. **To See Changes in a Specific Commit**:\n```bash\ngit show <commit-hash>\n```\n\nWhat specifically are you trying to revert? This will help me provide more targeted guidance.\ni removed some files from this config and i want them back in\nTo recover deleted files from Git history, you can:\n\n1. **First, find when the files were deleted**:\n```bash\ngit log --diff-filter=D --summary  # Shows commits with deleted files\n```\n\n2. **To see the specific files in a commit**:\n```bash\ngit show <commit-hash>\n```\n\n3. **To restore files from a specific commit**:\n```bash\n# Restore a specific file from a previous commit\ngit checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/file\n\n# Restore multiple files\ngit checkout <commit-hash> -- file1 file2\n\n# Restore an entire directory\ngit checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/directory/\n```\n\n4. **If you want to restore to a specific point in time**:\n```bash\n# See the state at a specific commit\ngit checkout <commit-hash>\n\n# Create a new branch at this point if you want to keep these changes\ngit checkout -b recovery-branch\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you find the specific commit where your files were deleted? You can share what files you're looking for, and we can track down when they were removed.\nI removed text from files and want it back\nTo find and restore text that was removed from files:\n\n1. **Find when the changes were made**:\n```bash\n# See changes to specific file\ngit log -p filename\n\n# Or use a more visual way\ngit log --oneline\ngit show <commit-hash>\n```\n\n2. **To see differences between current version and a previous version**:\n```bash\ngit diff <commit-hash> filename\n```\n\n3. **To restore the file to a previous version**:\n```bash\n# Restore specific file to version from specific commit\ngit checkout <commit-hash> -- filename\n\n# Or to restore the whole file from the previous commit\ngit checkout HEAD^ -- filename\n```\n\n4. **To interactively see changes**:\n```bash\n# Visual tool if you have it configured\ngit difftool <commit-hash> filename\n```\n\nCan you tell me which files had text removed? I can help you find the specific commits where the changes were made.\nfailed to sign can i just skip signing\n\nYes, you can skip signing commits temporarily in a few ways:\n\n1. **For a single commit**:\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"your message\" --no-gpg-sign\n# or\ngit -c commit.gpgsign=false commit -m \"your message\"\n```\n\n2. **Disable signing temporarily in the repo**:\n```bash\ngit config commit.gpgsign false\n```\n\n3. **To re-enable signing later**:\n```bash\ngit config commit.gpgsign true\n```\n\nYou can also disable it globally if needed:\n```bash\ngit config --global commit.gpgsign false\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you disable signing temporarily so you can make your commit?\nis it normal for emacs to take a long time to load\nYes, Emacs can take a while to load, especially with configurations like Doom Emacs, but there are ways to improve it:\n\nCommon reasons for slow loading:\n1. Many packages being loaded at startup\n2. Large configuration files\n3. Loading everything at once instead of lazy loading\n\nTips to improve load time:\n\n1. **Use Doom's built-in profiler**:\n```bash\ndoom doctor    # Check for issues\ndoom profile   # See what's taking time\n```\n\n2. **Use native compilation** (in your Nix config):\n```nix\nprograms.emacs = {\n  enable = true;\n  package = pkgs.emacsPgtk;  # or emacsNativeComp\n};\n```\n\n3. **Defer loading of packages** (in Doom's config):\n```elisp\n;; In config.el\n(use-package! some-package\n  :defer t  ; Only load when needed\n  )\n```\n\n4. **Start Emacs as a daemon**:\n```bash\n# In your shell config\nalias ec=\"emacsclient -c -a ''\"\n```\n\n5. **Check your init.el and config.el** for unnecessary packages\n\nWould you like help implementing any of these optimizations?\nwhats a step by step guide to learning emacs\n\nHere's a progressive guide to learning Emacs:\n\nWEEK 1: BASICS\n1.

Basic Org mode:\n   - Headers (*)\n   - TODO items\n   - Lists\n   - Tables\n   - Links\n\nRECOMMENDED APPROACH:\n1. Start with Doom Emacs:\n   ```bash\n   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.emacs.d\n   ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install\n   ```\n\n2. Keep these resources handy:\n   - Built-in help: `C-h ?`\n   - Info manual: `C-h i`\n   - Function help: `C-h f`\n   - Variable help: `C-h v`\n\n3. Practice daily:\n   - Use for text editing\n   - Try new commands\n   - Read documentation\n\n4. Watch tutorials:\n   - System Crafters (YouTube)\n   - Protesilaos Stavrou\n   - David Wilson\n\n5. Customize gradually:\n   - Start with basic config\n   - Add features as needed\n   - Learn some Elisp\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?\n⛔ Error (use-package): Cannot load exec-path-from-shell\n⛔ Warning (comp): libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver\n\nLet's fix both issues:\n\n1. **First Error: exec-path-from-shell**\nThis is a package that needs to be installed. In Doom Emacs, add to your `~/.doom.d/packages.el`:\n\n```elisp\n(package! exec-path-from-shell)\n```\n\nThen in your `~/.doom.d/config.el`:\n```elisp\n(when (or (daemonp) (memq window-system '(mac ns x)))\n  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))\n```\n\nAfter adding this, run:\n```bash\ndoom sync\n```\n\n2. **Second Error: libgccjit**\nThis is related to native compilation. On Nix, you need to ensure you have the right dependencies:\n\nIn your nix configuration:\n```nix\n{ pkgs, ... }: {\n  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [\n    gcc\n    libgccjit\n  ];\n  \n  programs.emacs = {\n    enable = true;\n    package = pkgs.emacsPgtk;  # or emacsNativeComp\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAfter updating your configuration:\n```bash\ndarwin-rebuild switch\n```\n\nThen restart Emacs completely. If you're still having issues, you can temporarily disable native compilation by adding this to your `~/.doom.d/init.el`:\n```elisp\n(setq comp-deferred-compilation nil)\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you implement these fixes?\nlets go back to the keys not being signed\n\nLet's solve the Git signing issue. We have a few approaches:\n\n1. **First, let's verify your YubiKey setup**:\n```bash\n# Check if YubiKey is recognized\ngpg --card-status\n\n# List your keys\ngpg --list-keys\n```\n\n2. **Check your Git configuration**:\n```bash\n# See what email Git is using\ngit config --get user.email\n\n# See what signing key Git is using\ngit config --get user.signingkey\n```\n\n3. **Options to proceed**:\n\nA. **Fix the signing** (recommended):\n```bash\n# Set your signing key (replace with your key ID)\ngit config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID\n\n# Make sure Git uses the right email\ngit config --global user.email \"michael.e.kirl@gmail.com\"\n\n# Restart GPG agent\ngpgconf --kill gpg-agent\ngpg-agent --daemon\n```\n\nB. **Temporarily disable signing**:\n```bash\n# Disable for this commit only\ngit commit --no-gpg-sign -m \"your message\"\n\n# Or disable for this repository\ngit config commit.gpgsign false\n\n# Or disable globally\ngit config --global commit.gpgsign false\n```\n\nWhich approach would you prefer to take? We can either fix the signing properly or temporarily disable it to get your changes committed.\nI would like to fix it\n\nOkay, let's fix it step by step:\n\n1. First, let's check what GPG sees:\n```bash\n# Check YubiKey status\ngpg --card-status\n\n# List your keys\ngpg --list-keys\n```\nCan you share the output of these commands?\n\n2. Then verify Git's current configuration:\n```bash\ngit config --get user.email\ngit config --get user.signingkey\n```\n\n3. Since you mentioned earlier that you imported your public key, let's make sure GPG and the YubiKey are communicating:\n```bash\n# Restart relevant services\ngpgconf --kill gpg-agent\ngpg-agent --daemon\n\n# For macOS with Nix, also ensure:\ngpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye\n```\n\nCould you run these commands and share the outputs? This will help us identify exactly where the configuration needs to be adjusted.\n\nAlso, do you have this in your nix-darwin configuration?\n```nix\nprograms.gnupg.agent.enable = true;\nservices.pcscd.enable = true;\n```\nwould this go in the default.nix\nYes, this would go in your configuration files. For nix-darwin, you can add it to either:\n\n1. In your `flake.nix` under the darwin configuration:\n```nix\n{\n  darwin.configurations.\"your-hostname\" = darwin.lib.darwinSystem {\n    modules = [ \n      ({ pkgs, ... }: {\n        programs.gnupg.agent.enable = true;\n        services.pcscd.enable = true;\n\n        # Also good to add:\n        environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [\n          gnupg\n          pinentry_mac\n          yubikey-manager\n        ];\n      })\n    ];\n  };\n}\n```\n\n2. Or in your `configuration.nix`/`default.nix`:\n```nix\n{ pkgs, ... }: {\n  programs.gnupg.agent.enable = true;\n  services.pcscd.enable = true;\n\n  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [\n    gnupg\n    pinentry_mac\n    yubikey-manager\n  ];\n}\n```\n\nAfter adding this, rebuild your configuration:\n```bash\ndarwin-rebuild switch\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you integrate this into your specific configurati\n\nWhat is pcscd\nPCSCD (PC/SC Daemon) is a crucial service for smart card communication. Specifically:\n\n1. **What it does**:\n- Manages communication between software and smart card readers/cards\n- Provides an interface for applications (like GPG) to talk to smart cards\n- Essential for YubiKey functionality in GPG operations\n\n2. **Why it's needed**:\n- Required for YubiKey GPG operations\n- Handles smart card reader detection\n- Manages communication protocols\n\n3. **In the context of YubiKey**:\n- Allows GPG to communicate with your YubiKey\n- Required for signing operations\n- Enables secure key operations\n\n4. **In your nix configuration**:\n```nix\nservices.pcscd = {\n  enable = true;  # Enables the smart card daemon\n};\n```\n\nThink of it as a \"translator\" between your YubiKey (hardware) and GPG (software). Without it, your system can't properly communicate with the YubiKey for operations like signing commits.\nThe option `services.pcscd' does not exist\n\nAh, for nix-darwin, the configuration is slightly different. PCSCD is handled through homebrew services instead. Here's the correct way:\n\nIn your nix configuration:\n```nix\n# For nix-darwin\nhomebrew = {\n  enable = true;\n  casks = [ \"yubico-yubikey-manager\" ];\n  brews = [ \"pcscd\" ];\n};\n\nprograms.gnupg.agent.enable = true;\n```\n\nThen after rebuilding, you can start the service with:\n```bash\nbrew services start pcscd\n```\n\nOr if you want to manage it through launchd:\n```bash\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.pcscd.pcscd.plist\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you integrate this into your configuration?\n\nno formulae found for pcscd\n\n\nno formulae found for pcscd\n\nAh, on macOS/nix-darwin, we don't need to explicitly install pcscd as it's handled by the OS. Let's focus on the essential GPG setup:\n\n```nix\n{ pkgs, ... }: {\n  programs.gnupg.agent.enable = true;\n\n  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [\n    gnupg     # GPG itself\n    pinentry_mac  # For password prompts\n    yubikey-manager  # YubiKey management\n  ];\n\n  homebrew = {\n    enable = true;\n    casks = [ \n      \"yubico-yubikey-manager\"  # GUI YubiKey manager\n    ];\n  };\n}\n```\n\nThen create/edit `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`:\n```bash\npinentry-program /opt/homebrew/bin/pinentry-mac\nenable-ssh-support\n```\n\nAfter adding this:\n1. Rebuild your configuration:\n```bash\ndarwin-rebuild switch\n```\n\n2. Restart GPG agent:\n```bash\ngpgconf --kill gpg-agent\ngpg-agent --daemon\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you implement these changes?\nwhen i try to sign a commit i get \nerror: gpg failed to sign the data:\ngpg: skipped \"127913D765766175E2BB3DECBA08C086164FDF69\": No secret key\n[GNUPG:] INV_SGNR 9 127913D765766175E2BB3DECBA08C086164FDF69\n[GNUPG:] FAILURE sign 17\ngpg: signing failed: No secret key\n\nfatal: failed to write commit object\n\nLet's fix this step by step. This error means GPG can see your public key but can't access the private key on your YubiKey.\n\n1. First, make sure your YubiKey is properly inserted and recognized:\n```bash\ngpg --card-status\n```\n\n2. Let's see what GPG keys you have:\n```bash\n# List public keys\ngpg --list-keys\n\n# List secret keys\ngpg --list-secret-keys\n```\n\n3. Force GPG to refresh your YubiKey:\n```bash\ngpg-connect-agent \"scd serialno\" \"learn --force\" /bye\ngpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye\n```\n\n4. Verify Git is using the correct key:\n```bash\n# Set your key ID\ngit config --global user.signingkey 127913D765766175E2BB3DECBA08C086164FDF69\n\n# Ensure your email matches\ngit config --global user.email \"michael.e.kirl@gmail.com\"\n```\n\n5. Reset the GPG agent:\n```bash\ngpgconf --kill gpg-agent\ngpg-agent --daemon\n```\n\nCan you run `gpg --card-status` and share what it shows? This will help us verify if your YubiKey is being properly recognized.\nthat worked thanks\nGreat! Just for future reference, here's what we did to fix the signing:\n\n1. Refreshed the YubiKey connection:\n```bash\ngpg-connect-agent \"scd serialno\" \"learn --force\" /bye\ngpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye\n```\n\n2. Reset GPG agent:\n```bash\ngpgconf --kill gpg-agent\ngpg-agent --daemon\n```\n\nIf you ever have signing issues again:\n- Make sure YubiKey is inserted\n- Run these commands\n- Verify with `gpg --card-status`\n\nWould you like to know any other GPG or YubiKey commands for future reference?\nhow can i see what differences there are from the 3rd commit to the latest in git\nhow can i see what differences there are from the 3rd commit to the latest in git\n\nThere are several ways to see differences between commits:\n\n1. **To see all changes since the 3rd commit**:\n```bash\n# Using commit count\ngit diff HEAD~3 HEAD\n\n# Or using specific commit hash\ngit diff <commit-hash> HEAD\n```\n\n2. **To see a list of changed files**:\n```bash\ngit diff --name-only HEAD~3 HEAD\n```\n\n3. **To see a summary of changes**:\n```bash\ngit diff --stat HEAD~3 HEAD\n```\n\n4. **To see commit logs between these points**:\n```bash\ngit log HEAD~3..HEAD\n\n# Or more compact\ngit log --oneline HEAD~3..HEAD\n```\n\n5. **Visual diff tool** (if configured):\n```bash\ngit difftool HEAD~3 HEAD\n```\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these commands in more detail or help you examine specific changes?\nwhen i try to run emacs on nix-darwin i get this ⛔ Error (use-package): Cannot load exec-path-from-shell\n\nLet's fix this exec-path-from-shell error in your Nix Darwin + Doom Emacs setup:\n\n1. First, add the package to your `~/.doom.d/packages.el`:\n```elisp\n(package! exec-path-from-shell)\n```\n\n2. In your nix configuration (flake.nix or configuration.nix), make sure you have:\n```nix\n{ pkgs, ... }: {\n  programs.emacs = {\n    enable = true;\n    package = pkgs.emacs;    # or pkgs.emacsPgtk\n  };\n\n  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [\n    # Emacs dependencies\n    emacs\n    coreutils\n    fd\n    ripgrep\n    git\n  ];\n}\n```\n\n3. Run:\n```bash\n# Rebuild Doom's packages\ndoom sync\n\n# Rebuild nix configuration\ndarwin-rebuild switch\n```\n\n4.
