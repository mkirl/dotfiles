Different processes/programs running in each terminal session\n2. Terminal emulator differences\n3. Shell environment variations\n4. Background processes that started with each terminal\n5. Shell history and cache differences\n\nTo get more accurate comparisons, try:\n\n1. Use more precise tools:\n```bash\nps -o pid,ppid,%mem,rss,cmd -p $$\n# or\ntop -p $$ \n# or\nsmem -P $(ps -p $$ -o pid=)\n```\n\n2. Clear caches between measurements:\n```bash\nsync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n```\n\n3. Start fresh terminal sessions\n4. Use the same shell and environment\n\nCan you share:\n- Which terminal emulators you're using\n- The exact command you're running\n- The different results you're seeing\nThis would help diagnose the specific cause.\nWould a bloated shell configuration \nYes, a bloated shell configuration can definitely impact memory usage! This is a common cause of memory usage differences between terminals. Here are some common culprits:\n\n1. Shell RC Files:\n- `.bashrc`\n- `.zshrc`\n- `.profile`\n- `.bash_profile`\n\nThings that can bloat these files:\n```bash\n# Heavy aliases\n# Large PATH additions\n# Complex prompt configurations (PS1)\n# Too many environment variables\n# Heavy shell functions\n# Plugin managers (oh-my-zsh, etc.)\n# Command completion scripts\n```\n\n2. To check if this is your issue:\n```bash\n# Start a clean shell without loading RC files\nbash --noprofile --norc\n# or\nzsh -f\n\n# Compare memory usage with normal shell\nps -o pid,ppid,%mem,rss,cmd -p $$\n```\n\n3. To debug RC files:\n```bash\n# Add this to start of RC file to profile loading\nPS4='+ $BASH_SOURCE:$LINENO:'; set -x\n\n# Or use time to measure load time\ntime source ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n4. Common fixes:\n- Clean up unused aliases/functions\n- Remove unnecessary plugins\n- Lazy load features when needed\n- Use lighter alternatives for heavy tools\n- Profile and optimize prompt settings\n\nWould you like help analyzing your shell configuration files?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":316}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":114,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":317}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":12},"start":932,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":318}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":68},"start":969,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":319}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":69},"start":2111,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":320}}}],"summary":"Memory Monitoring Inconsistency Across Terminals","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
